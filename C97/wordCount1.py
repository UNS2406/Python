# declare two variables wordCount and characterCount in our program.
# The 'characterCount' variable is initialized to zero and the wordCount variable is initialized to 1.
# characterCount=0
# wordCount=1

# use a for loop to iterate on the string. To do that we'll write
# for character in introString: here "character" is the loop variable
# which will be assigned list elements from introString one after the other
# (including space). The for loop is used to traverse through the characters in the string

introString = input("Enter your introduction:")
characterCount = 0
wordCount = 1

# Inside the for loop to count the character we'll write :-
# (To write the statement or code inside a function we will add an indentation at the beginning)
# (The character count is incremented each time a character is encountered).
for i in introString:
    characterCount = characterCount + 1
    if(i == ' '):
        wordCount = wordCount+1
        
        # We'll check for the blank space in between the words. While iterating on the introString "character" also takes all the blank spaces it contains. So whenever "character" encounters
# a blank space we'll mark it as a word and increase the word count.
# The code for this would be: if(character == ' '):  wordCount=wordCount+1
# Note the user does not press space after the last word. This needs to be kept in account when printing the final wordCount, the final wordCount has
# to be increased by 1.
print("Number of words in the string:")
print(wordCount + 1)
print("Number of characters in the string:")
print(characterCount)

Indentation is very important while we are creating the class. __init__ is a pre-defined function in python and it is very similar to our
constructor in javascript. It is called whenever we create an object using the class. It takes some arguments and creates an object using the arguments.
You can see that __init__ function is taking several arguments.

self -> similar to this keyword in javascript. Not necessary to pass
name -> string 
age -> number
gender -> string
level -> number
grades -> this is a dictionary in python. similar to json object in javascript.

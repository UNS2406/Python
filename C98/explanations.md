1. Create a file called "test.txt"
2. Open python console. Use f = open("test.txt") to store the file in 'f' variable.
3. Use f.read() to read the file and then prints it on the console.


# - By default a file opens in read mode. 
# We could have also used open("test.txt",'r') to open the file explicitly in the read mode.
# - file is an object in python which has several functions defined on them.
# read() is a function defined on files.
# - "\n" represents the Enter or return key

# --  You can also print a file line by line in python.
# open() function can be used to open any file in read, write or append mode. 
# The function returns a file object which we can read in our program.


    f = open("test.txt")
    fileLines = f.readlines()

# readlines() defined on file object splits the lines in the file and stores it line by
# line as a list. We can print these lines by calling a for loop on the list.

    for line in fileLines:
        print(line)

# There are several other functions defined on files which you can explore
# on your own by referring to the documentation.


# A FILE IS AN OBJECT IN PYTHON

# For example - a variable which holds a string is also an object in python.

# Let's store a string inside a variable.

    introString = "My name is Wily, I am 15 years old."


# introString is a string object on which several functions are defined. One of the functions defined on introString is called split().
# split() splits the given string by their whitespaces, gives each individual word and stores them in a list. We can write:

    words = introString.split()
    print( words )


# split() splits using whitespace by default. You can also specify which separator to use to split the items.
# For example, we could have used comma (,) as the separator:

    phrases = introString.split(",")

- Again, there are several functions defined on string object in Python.
- You can look over them in the documentation for python.

- Now, we have used several functions which are pre-defined in python. Let's learn how to define a custom
- function in python. You already know how to define a custom function in javascript. 
- It is similar in python except for the change in syntax.

- To define a function in python, we use the syntax: 

    def functionName():
        <block of code for the function>

- You can also pass arguments to your function inside the brackets - similar to how we did in javascript.

    def functionName(variable):
        <block of code for the function>




# There are a lot of places where there is a restriction on the number of words to be used - for example while
# writing essays....we can use the program to count the number of words used.

# creating a countWordsFromFile.py file. Inside the file, let's create a custom function countWordsFromFile() which
# takes the file path as input.  We can open the file using open() in read mode.

# We can read all the lines in our file and store it in a list. For each line in the file, let's split the line by whitespace to store all the
# words in the line as a list.


# For each line in the file, you can use split() to split the line by whitespace and store the words in the words  list

# We use a numberOfWords variable which starts from 0 We count the number of words in the words list for each file and keep adding to
# the numberOfWords

# There is a predefined function len() in python which will give you the length of the list. We can use it to find the length of words listed # for each line.

    numberOfWords =0
    numberOfWords = numberOfWords + len(words) 
    
#  - to increment the value of count by the number of words in  each line of the file.

#1. import csv
#2. read the contents of the csv and remove the headers fromthe data>
#3.calculate the total marks of all the students in the classroomand find the total number of students>
#4. the formula (Sum of Marks of all the students/Total Students)>

import csv

with open('class1.csv', newline='') as f:
    reader = csv.reader(f)
    file_data = list(reader)

#To remove headers from CSV
file_data.pop(0)

total_marks = 0
total_entries = len(file_data)

for marks in file_data:
    total_marks += float(marks[1])

mean = total_marks / total_entries
print("Mean (Average) is -> "+str(mean))
#Note that when printing, we areconverting the mean from float type tostring type with the str() method.Float types are 
#numbers having adecimal value. In Python, we have tomake sure to convert integers or floats as string.


#X Coordinate should be thenumber of students, and theY Coordinate should be thenumber of marks obtained.
#1. import the plotly and pandaslibrary>
#2. read the csv file using Pandas
#3. create a scatter plot with Xcoordinate as the StudentNumber and Y Coordinateas the Marks>
#4. display the graph>
#5. One thing, that is different in this codefrom the previous one is that we are also displaying the line of average inour graph with the following code

#import pandas as pd
#import plotly.express as px

#df = pd.read_csv("class1.csv")

#fig = px.scatter(df,    x="Student Number",
                        y="Marks"
            )
#fig.update_layout(shapes=[
 #   dict(
 #     type= 'line',
 #     y0= mean, y1= mean,
 #     x0= 0, x1= total_entries
 #   )
#])

#To make both the graphs consistentbwith each other, we will add thebfollowing line 
#fig.update_yaxes(rangemode="tozero")


#fig.show()
